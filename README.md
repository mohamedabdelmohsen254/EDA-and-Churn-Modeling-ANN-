# EDA-and-Churn-Modeling-ANN-

This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.

What's the challenge here?

Well, the bank has been seeing unusual churn rates (churn is when people leave the company), and they've seen customers leaving at unusually high rates

They want to understand what the problem is and they want to assess and address that problem.

So what happened in reality is that this bank actually observed their customers for a certain period of time, let's say six months.

They observed if during the six months they left the bank or stayed in the bank and they gathered these outcomes in this last dependent variable, and at the same time, you know, they got all these features.
